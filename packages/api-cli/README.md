This folder contains the **API CLI**. The structure is the following:

```bash
└─ api-cli/
    └─ code/
      └─ commands/
    └─ config/
    └─ samples/
```

<br>

Once you install this CLI, you will be able to:

* [x] Verify if an API is well-designed.
* [x] Verify an API contract specification (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Avro, Protobuf Buffer) or the respective documentation files (Markdown).
* [x] Update the rulesets used to linter your certification files in the certification service.

## ⚙️ Installation and usage

1. You can start by cloning this repository: 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:inditex/mic-openapicertification.git
```

2. Install the downloaded code dependencies:  

```bash
npm i
```

3. Link the 'apicli' command to local installation:

```bash
npm link
```

<br>

Then, you can use any of these commands: 

- `refresh-ruleset`, which will update the rules used to validate your API in the certification service. 

- `verify`, with which you can obtain the certification of the API, all along with some helpful information like version numbers or protocol. 

- `verify-file`, verifies an OpenAPI specification file.
- general and command-dedicated `help`, in case you need further information.
